Hello! My name is Max and I am a behavioral neuroscience researcher at the NIH, working on neural circuits, vocalizations, and speech disorders. My interests are wide-ranging, but at the moment I'm particularly interested in interacting systems, including the physio-biochemical environment of marine ecosystems and the information processing systems of neural and _in silico_ computation.

## Research Interests

I'm passionate about integrating technological society with nature, believing that innovation must be measured in ecosystemic welfare, not merely societal. As such, I'm interested in the bi-directional flow between human technology and the natural world, with engineering principles being applied from nature to improve the human condition, and human ingenuity applied to protecting global ecosystems. 

I'm also fascinated about information flow in complex systems, be it in the biosphere, neural circuits, internet connectivity, and social networks. Harkening back to Shannon (1948), information is a universality that transcends the details of any particular system. 

Trained as a physicist, I'm want to seek out the hidden orders underlying diverse phenomena. With that, as a science communicator I work to develop analogies and tie-ins between initally disparate fields. 

Finally, as a global citizen and humanitarian, I work to promote the welfare of people, local and global, whenever I can. The greatest humanitarian crisis of our generation is the threat of climate change. Thus, I'm passionate about developing breakthrough solutions, ideas, and policy to help us tackle the problems of today and the challenges of tomorrow. 



## Personal Projects

Currently, I'm designing a algae-cultivation bioreactor for carbon sequestration and biofuel development. I aim to develop a closed-loop system that drips algae-filled water onto a filter for continual harvesting and processing.
