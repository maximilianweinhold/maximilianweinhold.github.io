Hello! My name is Max and I am a behavioral neuroscience researcher at the NIH, working on neural circuits, vocalizations, and speech disorders. My interests are wide-ranging, but at the moment I'm particularly interested in interacting systems, including the physio-biochemical environment of marine ecosystems and the information processing systems of neural and _in silico_ computation.

### Research Interests

I'm passionate about integrating technological society with nature, believing that a balance can be struck between the drive for knowledge and technological progress and our relationship with the natural world. As such, I'm interested in the bi-directional flow between human technology and natural ecosystems, with engineering principles being applied from the natural world to improve the human condition, and human ingenuity being applied to protecting our place in the global ecosystem. 

I'm also fascinated in the way that constitutents interact among varying systems, be it in the biosphere, neural circuits, internet connectivity, and social networks. The world is dominated by complex phenomena, in which a variety of parts interact to form an emergent whole. Understanding these phenomena will be a crucial step in developing the solutions to tomorrow's problems and revealing more about the world we live in. 

Trained as a physicist, I'm want to apply the principles of phase transitions, percolations, fluid flow, and fields to a variety of diverse phenomena. Nature is subtle but not malicious, and I aim to seek out the fundamental organizational principles of the world we live in. 

Climate change is the greatest threat to our continued and current existence. Yet climate action offers the most profound avenue to improving the world and the lives of all those that inhabit it. With a combination of breakthrough technologies, innovative policy solutions, and cooperative perseverance, I believe that we can accomplish anything we set our collective mind to. 

### Personal Projects

Currently, I'm designing a algae-cultivation bioreactor for carbon sequestration and biofuel development. I aim to develop a closed-loop system that
