# Advocating for Circles of Value over Hierarchies of Needs
<details>
	<summary></summary>
Adapting our relationship with the living planet is a necessary component of sustainable development and restoration. A classic conception of an individual’s motive system is the hierarchy of needs, demonstrating an individual’s climb toward self-actualization, fulfillment, or transcendence (1). This image is memorable and holds explanatory power, yet it is inherently egotistical, as the progress of an individual is guided through their yearning and needs rather than values that might extend to the socio-cultural sphere. Post-Keynesian economics utilizes the hierarchy of needs as an axiom for developing principles of consumer choice (2), which assures that consumer choice theory will prioritize the progression of individual needs over community values -- a glaring omission, particularly within collectivist cultures or when accounting for charitable or prosocial behavior. An expanded picture - one that encompasses an individual’s values and actions towards themselves, their community, culture, and environment - would extend the hierarchy of needs to circles of value. These circles of value would provide a closer match of consumer choice within an ecological framework, enabling the conditions for individual flourishing within ecological boundaries (3). This would reframe the psychological journey of the individual from one striving ‘upward’ to expanding outward, extending one’s values to promote planetary and collective health.  <br/><br/>
